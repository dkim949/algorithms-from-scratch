# Algorithms from Scratch

This project aims to implement various machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood.

## Project Structure

- `supervised/`: Implementations of supervised learning algorithms
- `unsupervised/`: Implementations of unsupervised learning algorithms
- `reinforcement/`: Implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms
- `utils/`: Utility functions for data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization
- `datasets/`: Sample datasets for testing and examples
- `examples/`: Jupyter notebooks with usage examples
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the implemented algorithms

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the implementations in the respective directories
4. Run the example notebooks to see the algorithms in action
